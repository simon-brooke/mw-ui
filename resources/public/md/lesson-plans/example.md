## Lesson plans

I haven't actually written any lesson plans, since I'm not a teacher and that 
isn't my skill. If you use MicroWorld in class, and find it useful, and would
like to contribute a lesson plan, please mail it to [me](mailto:simon@journeyman.cc).

Ideally your lesson plan should be written in 'markdown' style, the very simple
style which is used in this document and other documentation within the program,
but frankly it doesn't matter - I'll accept them in any format, including hand
written notes or even (gasp) Microsoft Word.
